# DUCK-Cards
quack quack honk

Hi! Ryan here. I made these cards for use in a puzzle called DUCK! The community liked these cards so much they wanted to be able to download the designs and use them for stuff, so here they are!

If you do use these cards please be sure to credit me for the design. Contact me on Discord if you have any questions, comments, or concerns: CloudGaming827#9910

Thanks! :D
